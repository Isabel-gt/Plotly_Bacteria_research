# Plotly_Bacteria_research
The objective of this project was to sample the bacteria of peoples belly button across the United Sates to later identify the bacteria species. The identity of each person in the study is anonymous, which is why an ID number is assigned. Now, each person can search for a certain ID and find the type of bacteria that is found in that persons belly button.
